BACTER
======

BACTER is a [BEAST 2](http://beast2.org) package which facilitates
inference of a (restricted kind of) ancestral recombination graph
(ARG) and related parameters from a sequence alignment.  It is based on the model
described in
[Didelot et al.'s 2010 Genetics paper](http://www.genetics.org/content/186/4/1435)
and is currently under heavy development.  Check back soon!
