[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tgvaughan/bacter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tgvaughan/bacter) [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/tgvaughan/bacter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/tgvaughan/bacter?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

BACTER is a [BEAST 2] (http://www.beast2.org)  package which facilitates
inference of a (restricted kind of) ancestral recombination graph (ARG) and
related parameters from a sequence alignment.  It is based on the model
described in [Didelot et al.'s 2010 Genetics paper] [1].

This archive contains the source code of the package and is therefore of
primary interest to programmers.  For installation and usage instructions, as
well as links to tutorials and other documentation, please visit the project
home page hosted at http://tgvaughan.github.io/bacter.
