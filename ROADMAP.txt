** TODO Operators [40%]

*** DONE Add/remove

*** TODO ARG scaler

    Scaler is implemented and seems to work when applied to just the
    clonal frame without recombination, but combining this with add/remove
    doesn't sample from the correct distribution for 2 taxon trees.

*** DONE Clonal frame operators

*** TODO Converted region shifter

*** TODO Recombinant edge shifter
