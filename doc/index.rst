Introduction
============

`Bacter`_ is a `BEAST 2`_ package dedicated to performing inference of bacterial
sequence data.  In general, it allows for joint inference of the Ancestral
Recombination Graph (ARG), recombination rates, tract lengths, substitution
rate and population dynamics.  Exactly what may be inferred from a given data
set depends heavily on the size of the data set, and the rates of recombination
and mutation for the population under study, and the sampling procedure.
